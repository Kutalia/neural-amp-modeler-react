# Neural Amp Modeler React JS Port
This is a web loader of Neural Amp Modeler profiles, using the [Neural Amp Modeler Core WASM](https://github.com/Kutalia/NeuralAmpModelerCore_WASM/tree/dev "Neural Amp Modeler Core WASM") module compiled by [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/ "Emscripten"). You can load your profiles and impulse response files.

Please keep in mind that modern browsers run Web Audio Worklet Processors with a fixed 128 buffer size while a sample rate defaults to the OS defined one.

# Running the Project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The configuration is extended using [CRACO](https://craco.js.org/ "CRACO") to set necessaary HTTP headers. You will need to run the project with a dev server (`npm start`) or configure headers in your server which is serving static files generated by `npm run build` (currently using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/ "Vercel") for automatic deployment and hosting).
